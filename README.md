# authzyin
asp.net core and React library enables server & client authorization by defining just once and code less.

## Motivation
Authorization is both simple and complex. Often we need to have proper authorization to protect server apis, and at the same time, provide similar authorization on the UI to make our experience more user firendly. The common practice is to write authorization logic once on the server (asp.net core in my case), and once on the client (e.g. in React).

If there are only a few authoriztaion policies/requirements, this is relatively easy and no big deal. But as our application grows, the work required to maintain and make sure both sides in sync also grows dramatically, and it's likely no longer a simple task.

I was thinking about whether we can have some libraries to enable the same authorization on both server and client - aka - write once, use in both places. This repo is my first try over the past few days.
It contains server library and client library to make this simple for you.

*Kindly note*: the server & client libraries can be used together, or standalone by themselves. When using together the libraries make the authorization much easier, but it's not a must.

## How to use this library
### Server:
1. Define your requirements and policies, like in the [sample project](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/blob/master/sample/AuthN/Requirements.cs). If you'd like, you can define your policies/requirements in a json config file and load it during your app startup. It depends on perosnal preference so I am not putting it as part of this library.
2. Use the AddAuthZyinAuthorization extension method to enable AuthZyin authorization and register your IAuthZyinContext context in Startup.cs.
```CSharp
    services.AddAuthZyinAuthorization(options =>
    {
        // add policies
        options.AddPolicy("isCustomer", Policies.IsCustomer);
        options.AddPolicy("CanEnterBar", Policies.CanEnterBar);
        ...
    });

    // Add scoped context, used for authorization on both server and client
    services.AddScoped<IAuthZyinContext, SampleAuthZyinContext>();
```
3. Use the policies in the standard asp.net core way (as param to ```AuthorizeAttribute``` for those which don't need resources, or as part of ```AuthorizeAsync``` if resource is required).
```CSharp
    // Authorize based on policy and resource
    var authResult = await this.authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync(
        this.httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.User,
        bar,                            // resource
        nameof(Policies.CanEnterBar));  // policy
```
**You don't need to worry about serializing and exposing api for this data to be shared with the client**. The library handles that for you automatically once you finishe these steps. You might also have have more complex authorization scenarios to handle. You can mix this with standard asp.net core requirement/handler behaviors - as long as those requirements are not inherited from Requirement class from this library they won't be sent or processed by the client.

### Client:
1. Initialize AuthZyinContext (similar as createStore in Redux, call this globally like [this](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/blob/master/authzyin.js/example/src/index.tsx)).
```TypeScript
    initializeAuthZyinContext();
```
2. Connect the AuthZyinProvider with your components like what's being done [here](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/blob/master/authzyin.js/example/src/App.tsx). Do this after authentication since the authzyin context api provided by the lib has ```AuthorizeAttribute``` specified for security reasons.
```TypeScript
    <AuthZyinProvider options={{ requestInitFn: getAuthorizationHeadersAsync }}>
        <MainContent />
    </AuthZyinProvider>
```
3. Use the useAuthorize hooks in your components as this [example](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/blob/master/authzyin.js/example/src/components/PlaceComponent.tsx).
```TypeScript
    const authorize = useAuthorize();
    const authorized = authorize('CanEnterBar', bar);
```
More details can be found [here](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/tree/master/authzyin.js).
**The client library can be used as a standalone library without having to use the server part**. To do this, just call ```initializeAuthZyinContext``` and provide your own ```AuthZyinContext``` object as the parameter. The client lib will then use the provided object as the context and skipping loading from server automatically.

## How to run locally
### VSCode with HMR
1. Build client lib first (with HMR)
```bash
    cd authzyin.js
    npm install
    npm start
```
2. Use VSCode to open the project root folder, then F5.

### Console
You might need two console windows from project root:
1. Start client lib
```bash
    cd authzyin.js
    npm install
    npm start
```
2. Start the sample asp.net core project
```bash
    cd sample
    dotnet run
```

## A bit more technical details
I chose to use [JSON path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) to represent requirement rules, so that requirements can be evaluated on the server, and at the same time can be serialized "as is" to the client for the UI to evaluate - in some kind of an automatic way. Both the asp.net core policy and requirements are sent to client so you can use the same policy definition for your client authorization.

Since I am a React fan, there is React hooks to help with authorization scenarios for the client as well.

**Server evaluation** - done with [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json). Newtonsoft.Json is limited in JSON path parsing, e.g. array filters like this ```[(@.length-1)]``` won't work. I'll research for a better parser in the future.

**Client evlauation** - done with [JsonPath-Plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus).

Currently supported requirement evaluation operations:
- RquiresRole
- Or condition with children requirements
- Value equals
- Value greater than
- Value greater than or equal to
- Contains

Each operator can be associated with a **Direction**. For example, you can check whether certain properties in the authorization context contains some values from a resource, or use a Contains with a reverse direction to check whether certain properties from the resource contains a value from the authorization context. This also means we don't need to support less than since it's just the reverse of greater than.

## Code structure
- [/lib](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/tree/master/lib): server library
- [/authzyin.js/src](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/tree/master/authzyin.js/src): client library
- [/sample](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/tree/master/sample): sample project
- [/authzyin.js/example](https://github.com/sidecus/authzyin/tree/master/authzyin.js/example): React SPA used by the sample project

Please feel free to open an issue if there is any question. And let me know if you find this useful.

*P.S. Please be mindful if you are using System.Text.Json in your code (default asp.net core 3 contract serializer/deserializer). It doesn't support deep polymorphysm (for good reasons - but I do need it in this library), and right now doesn't support field serialization. Keeping this in mind might help you when trouble shooting weird serialization related issues.*
